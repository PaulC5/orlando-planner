# Katie Concierge Redesign

## Concept
Transform the Orlando planner from a generic AI tool into a kitschy, fun AI concierge character named Katie.

**Tone:**
- AI-forward (not hiding it, celebrating it)
- Warm, helpful, slightly cheeky
- Like talking to a friend who happens to be really good at planning trips
- Florida kitsch vibes (palm trees, neon, 80s vacation aesthetic potential)

**Katie's backstory:**
- AI concierge trained on 10 years of Orlando vacation rental hosting data
- "I've helped over 500 families plan their perfect Orlando trips"
- Knows the parks, the crowds, the secrets
- Doesn't pretend to be human, but has personality

### Social Proof
**Quote:**
"Katie saved our butts. We followed her plan and actually had FUN instead of arguing in the Magic Kingdom parking lot at 2pm."

### Footer Disclaimer (kitschy + honest)
"Katie is powered by AI and trained on Orlando vacation data. She's not perfect, but she's pretty damn good. And free!"

## Question Flow (NEW)

Instead of generic "Getting Started" sections, make it feel like Katie is asking the questions.

### Opening Message (before first question)
"Awesome! Let's figure out your perfect Orlando trip. I'm going to ask you about 12 quick questions—stuff like who's coming, what vibe you want, and how you feel about crowds. Ready? Let's go! 🎢"

### Sample Questions (rewritten in Katie's voice)

**Question 1 (Experience):**
"First things first—is this your first rodeo in Orlando?"
- Yes, total newbie!
- Been once or twice
- I practically live here

**Question 2 (Vibe):**
"What's the vibe? Are we going full chaos mode or keeping it chill?"
- Relaxed — no rushing, plenty of pool time
- Balanced — active but not insane
- GO MODE — pack it all in, sleep when we're dead

**Question 3 (Days):**
"How many days do I have to work with?"
- 2-3 days (quick hit)
- 4-5 days (sweet spot)
- 6-7 days (living the dream)
- 8+ days (okay, show-off 😄)

**Question 7 (Parks):**
"Which parks are calling your name? (Pick all that sound good)"
- Magic Kingdom (the classic)
- EPCOT (food! future! booze!)
- Hollywood Studios (Star Wars, baby)
- Animal Kingdom (animals + rides)
- Universal Studios (Harry Potter, etc.)
- Islands of Adventure (Jurassic, Marvel, more Potter)
- SeaWorld
- LEGOLAND (if you've got little ones)
- Not sure — help me decide, Katie!

**Question 8 (Crowds):**
"Real talk: how do you feel about crowds and lines?"
- I hate them—I'll pay to skip lines
- Meh, I'll deal if I have to
- Crowds don't bother me, we vibe

**Email Question:**
"Cool! Where should I send your custom itinerary?"
[email input]
"I'll email it to you in about 2 minutes. No spam, no BS. Just your plan."

**Submit button:** "Build My Plan, Katie! ✨"

## Visual Ideas (Optional)

- **Katie avatar:** Retro 80s/90s vacation aesthetic—sunglasses, palm tree shirt, maybe a fanny pack
- **Color palette:** Keep the gradient but maybe lean into Florida kitsch—pinks, teals, sunset oranges
- **Illustrations:** Pixel art or line-drawn Katie in different poses throughout the flow
- **Easter eggs:** Subtle fun touches (e.g., loading spinner says "Katie's crunching the data..." or "Checking the crowd calendars...")

---

## Next Steps

1. Update `page.tsx` with new landing copy
2. Update `plan/page.tsx` with Katie-voice questions
3. Update results page to say "Katie's building your plan..." and maybe include a fun loading state
4. Optional: Add a Katie avatar/illustration (AI-generated or simple illustration)
5. Test the vibe—does it feel fun or too much?

**Goal:** Make people smile when they use it. Make it memorable. Make it shareable because it's *different*.
